## 📖 Reading Files Using `cat`, `sort`, and `uniq`

### 🔹 Using `cat`

Displays the content of a file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```

View multiple files:

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

---

### 🔹 Using `sort`

Sort file content alphabetically:

```bash
sort file.txt
```

Sort numerically:

```bash
sort -n numbers.txt
```

Reverse sort:

```bash
sort -r file.txt
```

---

### 🔹 Using `uniq`

Remove duplicate adjacent lines:

```bash
uniq file.txt
```

Count repeated lines:

```bash
uniq -c file.txt
```

👉 **Note:** `uniq` works best with sorted files:

```bash
sort file.txt | uniq
```

## 🔍 Introduction to the `find` Utility

The `find` command is used to **search files and directories** based on conditions such as name, type, size, permissions, and modification time.

It searches recursively from a given path.

## 🧩 Basic Syntax of `find`

```bash
find <path> <options> <expression>
```

Example:

```bash
find /home/user -name file.txt
```
